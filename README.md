Go to the latest Releases on the right side and Download WMR.zip




(to open the software, go to the dist folder and open wmr.exe)


REQUIREMENTS

To use this Software, you will have to have Vjoy installed and configured in Regedit to appear as a Steering Wheel in game.
Make sure to also unbind Steer Left and right for your Controller and bind it for Vjoy.
After you have done it, choose your controller device at the Top Left corner of the Main Window of this Software.
You also need to have Vigem Bus Driver installed and Vgamepad to be able to use the Input Switch. (vgamepad should auto install)


SUGGESTED SETTINGS

For People new to Wheelmode, I highly Recommend 75 Linearity with 0 smoothing, yet if you cant control it, use 85 Linearity with 0.7-1 smoothing.
If ur pro use 0 Smoothing with 100 Linearity.


PROFILES

Profiles allow you to create different settings and change between them quickly instead of having to change all values.
After changing a Profile, restart the Software to fix the flashing Graph. (idk how to fix)


LINEARITY

With this option you can choose the Linearity you want to use. Values range from 50 to 150.
A Value below 100 will give you less input at small steering angles and will exponentially grow.
A Value above 100 will give more Steering Output at small Angles and exponentially less the more you steer.


SMOOTHING

Smoothing Values range from 0 to 1 and allow you to delay your Steering input aka smooth it out if you are not used to Wheelmode yet.


REVERSE

When holding down your binded reverse button, you will get a clutch axis output and a button output through vjoy (Clutch + Reverse).
Upon Release, you will get 2 Keyboard outputs (Clutch + Gear 1-7). This will help you perform the Reverse glitch to preserve your Speed.


INPUT SWITCH

This allows you to swap between Wheelmode and normal Controller Input with just one click.
